"""Find mainframe-artifacts: installed, or in the sibling mainframe-common checkout.

This package's one dependency ships from the mainframe-common repository. Installed,
it is simply importable. From a bare dual-checkout - that repo and this one side by
side, nothing installed - its src goes on sys.path. Override the checkout location
with MAINFRAME_COMMON_REPO.

Shared by conftest.py (which ignores the suite when nothing is found) and the sentinel
test module that reports the absence as ONE clean skip naming the exact pip command.
Same pattern, same names as cobol-xstate-json's copy - the two consumers should fail
and recover identically.
